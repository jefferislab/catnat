Description: A selection of functions for analysis of neuronal morphology and
    connectivity created for use alongside the nat and catmaid packages. Many
    of the functions are driven by the need to analyse the results of annotation
    of 3D electron microscopy data from the `CATMAID` web application. This 
    package is largely an incubator for work by Alex Bates and is subject to 
    frequent updates.
